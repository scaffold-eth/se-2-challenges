🎫 Create a simple NFT:

👷‍♀️ You'll compile and deploy your first smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template NextJS app full of important Ethereum components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy an NFT to a public network to share with friends! 🚀

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that lets users purchase and transfer NFTs. Deploy your contracts to a testnet, then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Environment 📚

> Start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

\`\`\`
yarn chain
\`\`\`

> in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

\`\`\`
yarn deploy
\`\`\`

> in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

\`\`\`
yarn start
\`\`\`

📱 Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## Checkpoint 1: ⛽️ Gas & Wallets 👛

> ⛽️ You'll need to get some funds from the faucet for gas.

![gas&wallet](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/912d0d4b-db34-49d3-bd7d-7ca0ab18eb66)

> 🦊 At first, **don't** connect MetaMask. If you are already connected, click **Disconnect**:

> 🔥 We'll use burner wallets on localhost.

> 👛 Explore how burner wallets work in 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 by opening a new incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You'll notice it has a new wallet address in the top right. Copy the incognito browser's address and send localhost test funds to it from your first browser (using the **Faucet** button in the bottom left):

![icognito&webBrowser](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/fd191447-a31f-4c03-a36f-936bfb70c2a1)

> 👨🏻‍🚒 When you close the incognito window, the account is gone forever. Burner wallets are great for local development but you'll move to more permanent wallets when you interact with public networks.

---

## Checkpoint 2: 🖨 Minting

> ✏️ Mint some NFTs! Click the **MINT NFT** button in the  \`My NFTs\` tab.

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/74cf02f2-4c1b-4278-9841-f19f668e0b1e)

👀 You should see your NFTs start to show up:

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/63dabceb-ad42-4c09-8e5d-a0139939e32d)

👛 Open an incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000

🎟 Transfer an NFT to the incognito window address using the UI:

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/3b92fb50-d43f-48a8-838c-c45c443b0b71)

👛 Try to mint an NFT from the incognito window.

> Can you mint an NFT with no funds in this address? You might need to grab funds from the faucet to pay for the gas!

🕵🏻‍♂️ Inspect the \`Debug Contracts\` tab to figure out what address is the owner of YourCollectible?

🔏 You can also check out your smart contract \`YourCollectible.sol\` in \`packages/hardhat/contracts\`.

💼 Take a quick look at your deploy script \`00_deploy_your_contract.js\` in \`packages/hardhat/deploy\`.

📝 If you want to edit the frontend, navigate to \`packages/nextjs/app\` and open the specific page you want to modify. For instance: \`/myNFTs/page.tsx\`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.

## Checkpoint 3: 💾 Deploy your contract! 🛰

🛰 Ready to deploy to a public testnet?!?

> Change the defaultNetwork in \`packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts\` to \`sepolia\`.

![chall-0-hardhat-config](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/f94b47d8-aa51-46eb-9c9e-7536559a5d45)

You will be prompted to enter a password, which will be used to encrypt your private key. **Make sure to remember this password, as you'll need it for future deployments and account queries.**

🔐 Generate a deployer address with \`yarn generate\`. This creates a unique deployer address and saves the mnemonic locally.

> This local account will deploy your contracts, allowing you to avoid entering a personal private key.

![chall-0-yarn-generate](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/2486142/133f5701-e575-4cc2-904f-cdc83ae86d94)

👩‍🚀 Use \`yarn account\` to view your deployer account balances.

![chall-0-yarn-account](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/2486142/c34df8c9-9793-4a76-849b-170fae7fd0f0)

⛽️ You will need to send ETH to your deployer address with your wallet, or get it from a public faucet of your chosen network.

> Some popular Sepolia faucets are the [Alchemy Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/), [Infura Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia), and [Google Cloud Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia).

> ⚔️ Side Quest: Keep a 🧑‍🎤 [punkwallet.io](https://punkwallet.io) on your phone's home screen and keep it loaded with testnet eth. 🧙‍♂️ You'll look like a wizard when you can fund your deployer address from your phone in seconds.

🚀 Deploy your NFT smart contract with \`yarn deploy\`.

> 💬 Hint: You can set the \`defaultNetwork\` in \`hardhat.config.ts\` to \`sepolia\` **OR** you can \`yarn deploy --network sepolia\`.

---

## Checkpoint 4: 🚢 Ship your frontend! 🚁

> ✏️ Edit your frontend config in \`packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts\` to change the \`targetNetwork\` to \`chains.sepolia\` :

![chall-0-scaffold-config](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/12072395/ff03bda0-66c6-4907-a9ad-bc8587da8036)

> You should see the correct network in the frontend (http://localhost:3000):

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/50eef1f7-e1a3-4b3b-87e2-59c19362c4ff)

> 🦊 Since we have deployed to a public testnet, you will now need to connect using a wallet you own or use a burner wallet. By default 🔥 \`burner wallets\` are only available on \`hardhat\` . You can enable them on every chain by setting \`onlyLocalBurnerWallet: false\` in your frontend config (\`scaffold.config.ts\` in \`packages/nextjs/\`).

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/f582d311-9b57-4503-8143-bac60346ea33)

🚀 Deploy your NextJS App

\`\`\`
yarn vercel
\`\`\`

> You might need to log in to Vercel first by running \`yarn vercel:login\`. Once you log in (email, GitHub, etc), the default options should work.

> If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run \`yarn vercel --prod\`. If you omit the \`--prod\` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

> Follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. It'll give you a public URL.

⚠️ Run the automated testing function to make sure your app passes

\`\`\`
yarn test
\`\`\`

#### Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.
This is great to complete your **SpeedRunEthereum**.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

- 🔷 \`ALCHEMY_API_KEY\` variable in \`packages/hardhat/.env\` and \`packages/nextjs/.env.local\`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

- 📃 \`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY\` variable in \`packages/hardhat/.env\` with your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> 💬 Hint: It's recommended to store env's for nextjs in Vercel/system env config for live apps and use .env.local for local testing.

---

## Checkpoint 5: 📜 Contract Verification

You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running (\`yarn verify --network network_name\`) :

\`\`\`
yarn verify --network sepolia
\`\`\`

> It is okay if it says your contract is already verified. Copy the address of YourCollectable.sol and search it on sepolia Etherscan to find the correct URL you need to submit this challenge.

## Checkpoint 6: 💪 Flex!

👩‍❤️‍👨 Share your public url with a friend and ask them for their address to send them a collectible :)

## ⚔️ Side Quests

### 🦊 MetaMask NFTs

> 🎫 Want to see your new NFTs? Check your MetaMask extension! Your minted NFTs should appear in the NFTs section.

> 🌐 **Important**: Make sure you switch to the Sepolia testnet in MetaMask before checking for your NFTs, since that's where you deployed your contract.

> 🔍 Make sure you have minted some NFTs on your Vercel page, then open your MetaMask extension and navigate to the "NFTs" tab.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/challenge-simple-nft-example/extension/packages/nextjs/public/nfts.png)

> You can see your collection of shiny new NFTs directly in your wallet!

(It can take a while before they show up in MetaMask, but they should appear in the NFTs section once detected.)

> 🔧 **Not seeing your NFTs?** Sometimes MetaMask doesn't automatically detect new NFTs. You can manually add them by clicking "Import NFT" in the NFTs tab and entering network, your contract address and token ID.
