## Checkpoint 0: üì¶ Environment üìö

> Start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

\`\`\`sh
yarn chain
\`\`\`

> in a second terminal window, üõ∞ deploy your contract (locally):

\`\`\`sh
yarn deploy
\`\`\`

> in a third terminal window, start your üì± frontend:

\`\`\`sh
yarn start
\`\`\`

üì± Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

> üë©‚Äçüíª Rerun \`yarn deploy --reset\` whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend, update your current contracts with changes, or re-deploy it to get a fresh contract address.

‚ö†Ô∏è We have disabled AI in Cursor and VSCode and highly suggest that you do not enable it so you can focus on the challenge, do everything by yourself, and hence better understand and remember things. If you are using another IDE, please disable AI yourself.

üîß In case you want to enable AI for some reason, you can do it in the root folder of the project.
- Cursor: remove \`*\` from \`.cursorignore\` file
- VSCode: set \`chat.disableAIFeatures\` to \`false\` in \`.vscode/settings.json\` file
