              👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 A multisig wallet it&apos;s a smart contract that acts like a wallet, allowing us to secure assets by
              requiring multiple accounts to &quot;vote&quot; on transactions. Think of it as a treasure chest that can
              only be opened when all key parties agree.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center text-lg">
              📜 The contract keeps track of all transactions. Each transaction can be confirmed or rejected by the
              signers (smart contract owners). Only transactions that receive enough confirmations can be
              &quot;executed&quot; by the signers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center text-lg">
              🌟 The final deliverable is a multisig wallet where you can propose adding and removing signers,
              transferring funds to other accounts, and updating the required number of signers to execute a
              transaction. After any of the signers propose a transaction, it&apos;s up to the signers to confirm and
              execute it. Deploy your contracts to a testnet, then build and upload your app to a public web server.
