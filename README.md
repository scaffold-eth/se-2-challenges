# üö© Challenge #0: üéü Simple NFT Example

![readme-0](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/375b7797-6839-43cd-abe5-fca94d88e300)

üìö This tutorial is meant for developers that already understand the [ üñçÔ∏è basics ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlJPjJQZtC8).

üßë‚Äçüè´ If you would like a more gentle introduction for developers, watch our 15 video [üé• Web2 to Web3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJz1HruEnenAf80uOfDwBPqaliJkjKg69) series.

üé´ Create a simple NFT:

üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You'll compile and deploy your first smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template React app full of important Ethereum components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy an NFT to a public network to share with friends! üöÄ

üåü The final deliverable is an app that lets users purchase and transfer NFTs. Deploy your contracts to a testnet, then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

## Checkpoint 1: ‚õΩÔ∏è Gas & Wallets üëõ

> ‚õΩÔ∏è You'll need to get some funds from the faucet for gas.

![gas&wallet](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/912d0d4b-db34-49d3-bd7d-7ca0ab18eb66)

> ü¶ä At first, **don't** connect MetaMask. If you are already connected, click **Disconnect**:

</p>

> üî• We'll use burner wallets on localhost.

> üëõ Explore how burner wallets work in üèó Scaffold-ETH 2 by opening a new incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You'll notice it has a new wallet address in the top right. Copy the incognito browser's address and send localhost test funds to it from your first browser (using the **Faucet** button in the bottom left):

![icognito&webBrowser](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/fd191447-a31f-4c03-a36f-936bfb70c2a1)

> üë®üèª‚Äçüöí When you close the incognito window, the account is gone forever. Burner wallets are great for local development but you'll move to more permanent wallets when you interact with public networks.

---

## Checkpoint 2: üñ® Minting

> ‚úèÔ∏è Mint some NFTs! Click the **MINT NFT** button in the `My NFTs` tab.

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/74cf02f2-4c1b-4278-9841-f19f668e0b1e)

üëÄ You should see your NFTs start to show up:

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/63dabceb-ad42-4c09-8e5d-a0139939e32d)

üëõ Open an incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000

üéü Transfer an NFT to the incognito window address using the UI:

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/3b92fb50-d43f-48a8-838c-c45c443b0b71)

üëõ Try to mint an NFT from the incognito window.

> Can you mint an NFT with no funds in this address? You might need to grab funds from the faucet to pay for the gas!

üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Inspect the `Debug Contracts` tab to figure out what address is the owner of YourCollectible?

üîè You can also check out your smart contract `YourCollectible.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`.

üíº Take a quick look at your deploy script `00_deploy_your_contract.js` in `packages/hardhat/deploy`.

üìù If you want to edit the frontend, navigate to `packages/nextjs/app` and open the specific page you want to modify. For instance: `/myNFTs/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.

---

## Checkpoint 3: üíæ Deploy your contract! üõ∞

üõ∞ Ready to deploy to a public testnet?!?

> Change the defaultNetwork in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` to `sepolia` (or `optimismSepolia` if you prefer OP Sepolia for lower gas costs).

![chall-0-hardhat-config](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/f94b47d8-aa51-46eb-9c9e-7536559a5d45)

üîê Generate a deployer address with `yarn generate`. This creates a unique deployer address and saves the mnemonic locally.

> This local account will deploy your contracts, allowing you to avoid entering a personal private key.

![chall-0-yarn-generate](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/2486142/133f5701-e575-4cc2-904f-cdc83ae86d94)

üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Use `yarn account` to view your deployer account balances.

![chall-0-yarn-account](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/2486142/c34df8c9-9793-4a76-849b-170fae7fd0f0)

‚õΩÔ∏è You will need to send ETH to your deployer address with your wallet, or get it from a public faucet of your chosen network.

> Some popular Sepolia faucets are the [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia), [Infura Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia), and [Google Cloud Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia).

> If you're using OP Sepolia, you can get testnet ETH from the [Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet) or [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/optimism-sepolia).

> üåâ If you need to bridge funds from Sepolia to OP Sepolia, you can use the [Superchain Bridges](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit). This allows you to transfer ETH and other supported tokens between the two networks.

> ‚öîÔ∏è Side Quest: Keep a üßë‚Äçüé§ [punkwallet.io](https://punkwallet.io) on your phone's home screen and keep it loaded with testnet eth. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You'll look like a wizard when you can fund your deployer address from your phone in seconds.

üöÄ Deploy your NFT smart contract with `yarn deploy`.

> üí¨ Hint: You can set the `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.ts` to `sepolia` or `optimismSepolia` **OR** you can `yarn deploy --network sepolia` or `yarn deploy --network optimismSepolia`.

---

## Checkpoint 4: üö¢ Ship your frontend! üöÅ

> ‚úèÔ∏è Edit your frontend config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` to change the `targetNetwork` to `chains.sepolia` (or `chains.optimismSepolia` if you deployed to OP Sepolia):

![chall-0-scaffold-config](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/12072395/ff03bda0-66c6-4907-a9ad-bc8587da8036)

> You should see the correct network in the frontend (http://localhost:3000):

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/50eef1f7-e1a3-4b3b-87e2-59c19362c4ff)

> ü¶ä Since we have deployed to a public testnet, you will now need to connect using a wallet you own or use a burner wallet. By default üî• `burner wallets` are only available on `hardhat` . You can enable them on every chain by setting `onlyLocalBurnerWallet: false` in your frontend config (`scaffold.config.ts` in `packages/nextjs/`)

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/f582d311-9b57-4503-8143-bac60346ea33)

> üí¨ Hint: For faster loading of your transfer page, consider updating the `fromBlock` passed to `useScaffoldEventHistory` in [`packages/nextjs/app/transfers/page.tsx`](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/blob/challenge-0-simple-nft/packages/nextjs/app/transfers/page.tsx#L12) to `blocknumber - 10` at which your contract was deployed. Example: `fromBlock: 3750241n` (where `n` represents its a [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)). To find this blocknumber, search your contract's address on Etherscan and find the `Contract Creation` transaction line.

üöÄ Deploy your NextJS App

```shell
yarn vercel
```

> Follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. Once you log in (email, github, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

> If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run `yarn vercel --prod`. If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

‚ö†Ô∏è Run the automated testing function to make sure your app passes

```shell
yarn test
```

#### Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, üèó Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.  
This is great to complete your **SpeedRunEthereum**.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

- üî∑`ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).

- üìÉ`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` with your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> üí¨ Hint: It's recommended to store env's for nextjs in Vercel/system env config for live apps and use .env.local for local testing.

---

## Checkpoint 5: üìú Contract Verification

You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running:

```shell
yarn verify --network sepolia
# Or for OP Sepolia:
# yarn verify --network optimismSepolia
```

> It is okay if it says your contract is already verified. Copy the address of YourCollectible contract and search it on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) (or [OP Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/)) to find the correct URL you need to submit this challenge.

## Checkpoint 6: üí™ Flex!

üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë® Share your public url with a friend and ask them for their address to send them a collectible :)

## ‚öîÔ∏è Side Quests

### üêü Open Sea

> üêÉ Want to see your new NFTs on Opensea? Head to [Testnets Opensea](https://testnets.opensea.io/)

> üé´ Make sure you have minted some NFTs on your Vercel page, then connect to Opensea using that same wallet.

![image](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/80153681/c752b365-b801-4a02-ba2e-62e0270b3795)

> You can see your collection of shiny new NFTs on a testnet!

(It can take a while before they show up, but here is an example:) https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/sepolia/0x17ed03686653917efa2194a5252c5f0a4f3dc49c/2

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: OpenSea might not work for Optimism Sepolia. In that case, you can view your NFTs on Optimism Sepolia Blockscout. Replace `YOUR_ADDRESS` with your actual address. https://optimism-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/YOUR_ADDRESS?tab=tokens_nfts
